<p class="t0">I met a lady from the South who said</p>
<p class="t0">(You won&rsquo;t believe she said it, but she said it):</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;None of my family ever worked, or had</p>
<p class="t0">A thing to sell.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t suppose the work</p>
<p class="t0">Much matters. You may work for all of me.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve seen the time I&rsquo;ve had to work myself.</p>
<p class="t0">The having anything to sell<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> is what</p>
<p class="t0">Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a traveller from Arkansas</p>
<p class="t0">Who boasted of his state as beautiful</p>
<p class="t0">For diamonds and apples. &ldquo;Diamonds</p>
<p class="t0">And apples in commercial quantities?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I asked him, on my guard. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered,</p>
<p class="t0">Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I see the porter&rsquo;s made your bed,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a Californian who would</p>
<p class="t0">Talk California&mdash;a state so blessed,</p>
<p class="t0">He said, in climate none had ever died there</p>
<p class="t0">A natural death, and Vigilance Committees</p>
<p class="t0">Had had to organize to stock the graveyards</p>
<p class="t0">And vindicate the state&rsquo;s humanity.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Just the way Steffanson runs on,&rdquo; I murmured,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;About the British Arctic. That&rsquo;s what comes</p>

<p class="t0">I met a poet from another state,</p>
<p class="t0">A zealot full of fluid inspiration,</p>
<p class="t0">Who in the name of fluid inspiration,</p>
<p class="t0">But in the best style of bad salesmanship,</p>
<p class="t0">Angrily tried to make me write a protest</p>
<p class="t0">(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act.</p>
<p class="t0">He didn&rsquo;t even offer me a drink</p>
<p class="t0">Until I asked for one to steady <i>him</i>.</p>
<p class="t0">This is called having an idea to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It never could have happened in New Hampshire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The only person really soiled with trade</p>
<p class="t0">I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Was someone who had just come back ashamed</p>
<p class="t0">From selling things in California.</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d built a noble mansard roof with balls</p>
<p class="t0">On turrets like Constantinople, deep</p>
<p class="t0">In woods some ten miles from a railroad station,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to put forever out of mind</p>
<p class="t0">The hope of being, as we say, received.</p>
<p class="t0">I found him standing at the close of day</p>
<p class="t0">Inside the threshold of his open barn,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And recognized him through the iron grey</p>
<p class="t0">In which his face was muffled to the eyes</p>
<p class="t0">As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed</p>
<p class="t0">A drover with me on the road to Brighton.</p>
<p class="t0">His farm was &ldquo;grounds,&rdquo; and not a farm at all;</p>
<p class="t0">His house among the local sheds and shanties</p>
<p class="t0">Rose like a factor&rsquo;s at a trading station.</p>
<p class="t0">And he was rich, and I was still a rascal.</p>
<p class="t0">I couldn&rsquo;t keep from asking impolitely,</p>
<p class="t0">Where had he been and what had he been doing?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p class="t0">How did he get so? (Rich was understood.)</p>
<p class="t0">In dealing in &ldquo;old rags&rdquo; in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh it was terrible as well could be.</p>
<p class="t0">We both of us turned over in our graves.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,</p>
<p class="t0">One each of everything as in a show-case</p>
<p class="t0">Which naturally she doesn&rsquo;t care to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She had one President (pronounce him Purse,</p>
<p class="t0">And make the most of it for better or worse.</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s your one chance to score against the state).</p>
<p class="t0">She had one Daniel Webster. He was all</p>
<p class="t0">The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be.</p>
<p class="t0">She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I call her old. She has one family</p>
<p class="t0">Whose claim is good to being settled here</p>
<p class="t0">Before the era of colonization,</p>
<p class="t0">And before that of exploration even.</p>
<p class="t0">John Smith remarked them as he coasted by</p>
<p class="t0">Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf</p>
<p class="t0">At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself</p>
<p class="t0">They weren&rsquo;t Red Indians but veritable</p>
<p class="t0">Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people,</p>
<p class="t0">Like those who furnished Adam&rsquo;s sons with wives;</p>
<p class="t0">However uninnocent they may have been</p>
<p class="t0">In being there so early in our history.</p>
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;d been there then a hundred years or more.</p>
<p class="t0">Pity he didn&rsquo;t ask what they were up to</p>
<p class="t0">At that date with a wharf already built,</p>
<p class="t0">And take their name. They&rsquo;ve since told me their name&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Today an honored one in Nottingham.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As for what they were up to more than fishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Suppose they weren&rsquo;t behaving Puritanly,</p>
<p class="t0">The hour had not yet struck for being good,</p>
<p class="t0">Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical.</p>
<p class="t0">It became an explorer of the deep</p>
<p class="t0">Not to explore too deep in others&rsquo; business.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has</p>
<p class="t0">One real reformer who would change the world</p>
<p class="t0">So it would be accepted by two classes,</p>
<p class="t0">Artists the minute they set up as artists,</p>
<p class="t0">Before, that is, they are themselves accepted,</p>
<p class="t0">And boys the minute they get out of college.</p>
<p class="t0">I can&rsquo;t help thinking those are tests to go by.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And she has one I don&rsquo;t know what to call him,</p>
<p class="t0">Who comes from Philadelphia every year</p>
<p class="t0">With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds</p>
<p class="t0">He wants to give the educational</p>
<p class="t0">Advantages of growing almost wild</p>
<p class="t0">Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Dorkings because they&rsquo;re spoken of by Chaucer,</p>
<p class="t0">Sussex because they&rsquo;re spoken of by Herrick.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p class="t0">You may have heard of it. I had a farm</p>
<p class="t0">Offered me not long since up Berlin way</p>
<p class="t0">With a mine on it that was worked for gold;</p>
<p class="t0">But not gold in commercial quantities.</p>
<p class="t0">Just enough gold to make the engagement rings</p>
<p class="t0">And marriage rings of those who owned the farm.</p>
<p class="t0">What gold more innocent could one have asked for?</p>

<p class="t0">One of my children ranging after rocks</p>

<p class="t0">A specimen of beryl with a trace</p>

<p class="t0">The trace would have to be the merest trace</p>
<p class="t0">To be below the threshold of commercial,</p>

<p class="t0">Of radium or anything to sell.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A specimen of everything, I said.</p>
<p class="t0">She has one witch&mdash;old style.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> She lives in Colebrook.</p>
<p class="t0">(The only other witch I ever met</p>
<p class="t0">Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.</p>
<p class="t0">There were four candles and four people present.</p>
<p class="t0">The witch was young, and beautiful (new style),</p>
<p class="t0">And open-minded. She was free to question</p>
<p class="t0">Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes.</p>
<p class="t0">Why was it so much greater when the boxes</p>
<p class="t0">Were metal than it was when they were wooden?</p>
<p class="t0">It made the world seem so mysterious.</p>
<p class="t0">The S&rsquo;ciety for Psychical Research</p>
<p class="t0">Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.</p>
<p class="t0">I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">New Hampshire <i>used</i> to have at Salem</p>
<p class="t0">A company we called the White Corpuscles,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose duty was at any hour of night</p>
<p class="t0">To rush in sheets and fool&rsquo;s caps where they smelled</p>
<p class="t0">A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented</p>
<p class="t0">And give someone the Skipper Ireson&rsquo;s Ride.</p>
<p class="t0">One each of everything as in a show-case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p class="t0">More than enough land for a specimen</p>

<p class="t0">Something else to protect her from herself.</p>
<p class="t0">There quality<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> makes up for quantity.</p>
<p class="t0">Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.</p>
<p class="t0">The farm I made my home on in the mountains</p>
<p class="t0">I had to take by force rather than buy.</p>
<p class="t0">I caught the owner outdoors by himself</p>
<p class="t0">Raking up after winter, and I said,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put you off this farm: I want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where are you going to put me? In the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put you on the farm next to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t the farm next to it do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I like this better.&rdquo; It was really better.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,</p>
<p class="t0">With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end</p>
<p class="t0">Of vitriol or arsenate of lead,</p>
<p class="t0">And so not good for anything but cider.</p>

<p class="t0">Anything I can say about New Hampshire</p>

<p class="t0">Emerson said, &ldquo;The God who made New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Taunted the lofty land with little men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Another Massachusetts poet said,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I go no more to summer in New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve given up my summer place in Dublin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire,</p>
<p class="t0">She said she couldn&rsquo;t stand the people in it,</p>
<p class="t0">The little men (it&rsquo;s Massachusetts speaking).</p>
<p class="t0">And when I asked to know what ailed the people,</p>
<p class="t0">She said, &ldquo;Go read your own books and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I may as well confess myself the author</p>
<p class="t0">Of several books against the world in general.</p>
<p class="t0">To take them as against a special state</p>
<p class="t0">Or even nation&rsquo;s to restrict my meaning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m what is called a sensibilitist,</p>

<p class="t0">When I left Massachusetts years ago</p>
<p class="t0">Between two days, the reason why I sought</p>
<p class="t0">New Hampshire, not Connecticut,</p>
<p class="t0">Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this:</p>
<p class="t0">Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered</p>
<p class="t0">The nearest boundary to escape across.</p>
<p class="t0">I hadn&rsquo;t an illusion in my hand-bag</p>

<p class="t0">I thought they couldn&rsquo;t be. And yet they were.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;d sure had no such friends in Massachusetts</p>

<p class="t0">For art&rsquo;s sake one could almost wish them worse<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="t0">The Russian novel in America</p>
<p class="t0">As long as life goes so unterribly?</p>
<p class="t0">There is the pinch from which our only outcry</p>
<p class="t0">In literature to date is heard to come.</p>
<p class="t0">We get what little misery we can</p>
<p class="t0">Out of not having cause for misery.</p>
<p class="t0">It makes the guild of novel writers sick</p>
<p class="t0">To be expected to be Dostoievskis</p>
<p class="t0">On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.</p>
<p class="t0">This is not sorrow, though; it&rsquo;s just the vapors,</p>
<p class="t0">And recognized as such in Russia itself</p>
<p class="t0">Under the new r&eacute;gime, and so forbidden.</p>
<p class="t0">If well it is with Russia, then feel free</p>
<p class="t0">To say so or be stood against the wall</p>
<p class="t0">And shot. It&rsquo;s Pollyanna now or death.</p>
<p class="t0">This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;</p>

<p class="t0">How high I&rsquo;d thrust the peaks in summer snow</p>
<p class="t0">To tap the upper sky and draw a flow</p>
<p class="t0">Of frosty night air on the vale below</p>
<p class="t0">Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The more the sensibilitist I am</p>

<p class="t0">The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p class="t0">After he&rsquo;d picked the lock and got it started,</p>
<p class="t0">He dodged a log that lifted like an arm</p>
<p class="t0">Against the sky to break his back for him,</p>
<p class="t0">Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life</p>
<p class="t0">Across the roar and chaos, and the words</p>
<p class="t0">We saw him say along the zigzag journey</p>
<p class="t0">Were doubtless as the words we heard him say</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>

<p class="t0">For all her mountains fall a little short,</p>
<p class="t0">Her people not quite short enough for Art,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lately in converse with a New York alec</p>
<p class="t0">About the new school of the pseudo-phallic,</p>
<p class="t0">I found myself in a close corner where</p>
<p class="t0">I had to make an almost funny choice.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Choose you which you will be&mdash;a prude, or puke,</p>
<p class="t0">Mewling and puking in the public arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Me for the hills where I don&rsquo;t have to choose.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But if you had to choose, which would you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I wouldn&rsquo;t be a prude afraid of nature.</p>
<p class="t0">I know a man who took a double axe</p>
<p class="t0">And went alone against a grove of trees;</p>
<p class="t0">But his heart failing him, he dropped the axe</p>
<p class="t0">And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood;</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s been enough shed without shedding mine.</p>
<p class="t0">Remember Birnam Wood! The wood&rsquo;s in flux!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He had a special terror of the flux</p>
<p class="t0">That showed itself in dendrophobia.</p>
<p class="t0">The only decent tree had been to mill</p>
<p class="t0">And educated into boards, he said.</p>
<p class="t0">He knew too well for any earthly use</p>
<p class="t0">The line where man leaves off and nature starts,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p class="t0">And never over-stepped it save in dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p class="t0">He stood on the safe side of the line talking;</p>
<p class="t0">Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism,</p>
<p class="t0">The cult of one who owned himself &ldquo;a foiled,</p>
<p class="t0">Circuitous wanderer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;took dejectedly</p>
<p class="t0">His seat upon the intellectual throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Agreed in frowning on these improvised</p>
<p class="t0">Altars the woods are full of nowadays,</p>
<p class="t0">Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned</p>
<p class="t0">By worship under green trees in the open.</p>
<p class="t0">Scarcely a mile but that I come on one,</p>
<p class="t0">A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal.</p>
<p class="t0">Even to say the groves were God&rsquo;s first temples</p>
<p class="t0">Comes too near to Ahaz&rsquo; sin for safety.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred.</p>
<p class="t0">But here is not a question of what&rsquo;s sacred;</p>
<p class="t0">Rather of what to face or run away from.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;d hate to be a runaway from nature.</p>
<p class="t0">And neither would I choose to be a puke</p>
<p class="t0">Who cares not what he does in company,</p>
<p class="t0">And, when he can&rsquo;t do anything, falls back</p>
<p class="t0">On words, and tries his worst to make words speak</p>
<p class="t0">Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it.</p>
<p class="t0">It seems a narrow choice the age insists on.</p>
<p class="t0">How about being a good Greek, for instance?</p>
<p class="t0">That course, they tell me, isn&rsquo;t offered this year.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, but this isn&rsquo;t choosing&mdash;puke or prude?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Well, if I have to choose one or the other,</p>
<p class="t0">I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer</p>
<p class="t0">With an income in cash of say a thousand</p>
<p class="t0">(From say a publisher in New York City).</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s restful to arrive at a decision,</p>
<p class="t0">And restful just to think about New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="t0">At present I am living in Vermont.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He did not see how like a flying thing</p>

<h2 id="ch3">THE CENSUS-TAKER</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening</p>
<p class="t0">To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house</p>
<p class="t0">Of one room and one window and one door,</p>
<p class="t0">The only dwelling in a waste cut over</p>
<p class="t0">A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:</p>
<p class="t0">And that not dwelt in now by men or women</p>
<p class="t0">(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,</p>
<p class="t0">So what is this I make a sorrow of?)</p>
<p class="t0">I came as census-taker to the waste</p>
<p class="t0">To count the people in it and found none,</p>
<p class="t0">None in the hundred miles, none in the house,</p>
<p class="t0">Where I came last with some hope, but not much</p>
<p class="t0">After hours&rsquo; overlooking from the cliffs</p>
<p class="t0">An emptiness flayed to the very stone.</p>
<p class="t0">I found no people that dared show themselves,</p>
<p class="t0">None not in hiding from the outward eye.</p>
<p class="t0">The time was autumn, but how anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Could tell the time of year when every tree</p>
<p class="t0">That could have dropped a leaf was down itself</p>
<p class="t0">And nothing but the stump of it was left</p>
<p class="t0">Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;</p>
<p class="t0">And every tree up stood a rotting trunk</p>
<p class="t0">Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">Or branch to whistle after what was spent.</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps the wind the more without the help</p>
<p class="t0">Of breathing trees said something of the time</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p class="t0">Of year or day the way it swung a door</p>
<p class="t0">Forever off the latch, as if rude men</p>
<p class="t0">Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him</p>
<p class="t0">For the next one to open for himself.</p>
<p class="t0">I counted nine I had no right to count</p>
<p class="t0">(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)</p>
<p class="t0">Before I made the tenth across the threshold.</p>
<p class="t0">Where was my supper? Where was anyone&rsquo;s?</p>
<p class="t0">No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.</p>
<p class="t0">The stove was cold&mdash;the stove was off the chimney&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And down by one side where it lacked a leg.</p>
<p class="t0">The people that had loudly passed the door</p>
<p class="t0">Were people to the ear but not the eye.</p>
<p class="t0">They were not on the table with their elbows.</p>
<p class="t0">They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.</p>
<p class="t0">I saw no men there and no bones of men there.</p>
<p class="t0">I armed myself against such bones as might be</p>
<p class="t0">With the pitch-blackened stub of an axe-handle</p>
<p class="t0">I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.</p>
<p class="t0">Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.</p>
<p class="t0">The door was still because I held it shut</p>
<p class="t0">While I thought what to do that could be done&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">About the house&mdash;about the people not there.</p>
<p class="t0">This house in one year fallen to decay</p>
<p class="t0">Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses</p>
<p class="t0">Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years</p>
<p class="t0">Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing was left to do that I could see</p>
<p class="t0">Unless to find that there was no one there</p>
<p class="t0">And declare to the cliffs too far for echo</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The place is desert and let whoso lurks</p>
<p class="t0">In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,</p>
<p class="t0">Break silence now or be forever silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p class="t0">Let him say why it should not be declared so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The melancholy of having to count souls</p>
<p class="t0">Where they grow fewer and fewer every year</p>
<p class="t0">Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.</p>
<p class="t0">It must be I want life to go on living.</p>

<h2 id="ch4">THE STAR-SPLITTER</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You know Orion always comes up sideways.</p>
<p class="t0">Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,</p>
<p class="t0">And rising on his hands, he looks in on me</p>
<p class="t0">Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something</p>
<p class="t0">I should have done by daylight, and indeed,</p>
<p class="t0">After the ground is frozen, I should have done</p>
<p class="t0">Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful</p>
<p class="t0">Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney</p>
<p class="t0">To make fun of my way of doing things,</p>
<p class="t0">Or else fun of Orion&rsquo;s having caught me.</p>
<p class="t0">Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights</p>
<p class="t0">These forces are obliged to pay respect to?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk</p>
<p class="t0">Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,</p>
<p class="t0">Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,</p>
<p class="t0">He burned his house down for the fire insurance</p>
<p class="t0">And spent the proceeds on a telescope</p>
<p class="t0">To satisfy a life-long curiosity</p>
<p class="t0">About our place among the infinities.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What do you want with one of those blame things?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I asked him well beforehand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get one!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call it blamed; there isn&rsquo;t anything</p>
<p class="t0">More blameless in the sense of being less</p>
<p class="t0">A weapon in our human fight,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p class="t0">And plowed between the rocks he couldn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p class="t0">Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years</p>
<p class="t0">Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,</p>
<p class="t0">He burned his house down for the fire insurance</p>
<p class="t0">And bought the telescope with what it came to.</p>
<p class="t0">He had been heard to say by several:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The best thing that we&rsquo;re put here for&rsquo;s to see;</p>
<p class="t0">The strongest thing that&rsquo;s given us to see with&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t0">A telescope. Someone in every town</p>
<p class="t0">Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.</p>
<p class="t0">In Littleton it may as well be me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">After such loose talk it was no surprise</p>
<p class="t0">When he did what he did and burned his house down.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mean laughter went about the town that day</p>
<p class="t0">To let him know we weren&rsquo;t the least imposed on,</p>
<p class="t0">And he could wait&mdash;we&rsquo;d see to him to-morrow.</p>
<p class="t0">But the first thing next morning we reflected</p>
<p class="t0">If one by one we counted people out</p>
<p class="t0">For the least sin, it wouldn&rsquo;t take us long</p>
<p class="t0">To get so we had no one left to live with.</p>
<p class="t0">For to be social is to be forgiving.</p>
<p class="t0">Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,</p>
<p class="t0">We don&rsquo;t cut off from coming to church suppers,</p>
<p class="t0">But what we miss we go to him and ask for.</p>
<p class="t0">He promptly gives it back, that is if still</p>
<p class="t0">Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.</p>
<p class="t0">It wouldn&rsquo;t do to be too hard on Brad</p>
<p class="t0">About his telescope. Beyond the age</p>
<p class="t0">Of being given one&rsquo;s gift for Christmas,</p>
<p class="t0">He had to take the best way he knew how</p>
<p class="t0">To find himself in one. Well, all we said was</p>
<p class="t0">He took a strange thing to be roguish over.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>

<p class="t0">Some sympathy was wasted on the house,</p>

<p class="t0">Didn&rsquo;t feel anything. And if it did,</p>
<p class="t0">Why not regard it as a sacrifice,</p>
<p class="t0">And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Out of a house and so out of a farm</p>
<p class="t0">At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn</p>
<p class="t0">To earn a living on the Concord railroad,</p>
<p class="t0">As under-ticket-agent at a station</p>
<p class="t0">Where his job, when he wasn&rsquo;t selling tickets,</p>
<p class="t0">Was setting out up track and down, not plants</p>
<p class="t0">As on a farm, but planets, evening stars</p>
<p class="t0">That varied in their hue from red to green.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="t0">His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.</p>
<p class="t0">Often he bid me come and have a look</p>
<p class="t0">Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,</p>
<p class="t0">At a star quaking in the other end.</p>
<p class="t0">I recollect a night of broken clouds</p>
<p class="t0">And underfoot snow melted down to ice,</p>
<p class="t0">And melting further in the wind to mud.</p>
<p class="t0">Bradford and I had out the telescope.</p>
<p class="t0">We spread our two legs as we spread its three,</p>
<p class="t0">Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,</p>

<p class="t0">With one stroke of your finger in the middle.</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s a star-splitter if there ever was one</p>

<p class="t0">Or for a little girl to guess sometime.</p>
<p class="t0">Not now&mdash;at least I shouldn&rsquo;t try too hard now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p class="t0">By and by I will tell you all I know</p>
<p class="t0">About the different trees, and something, too,</p>
<p class="t0">About your mother that perhaps may help.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.</p>
<p class="t0">Luckily all she wanted of her name then</p>
<p class="t0">Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day,</p>
<p class="t0">And give the teacher a scare as from her father.</p>
<p class="t0">Anything further had been wasted on her,</p>
<p class="t0">Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.</p>
<p class="t0">She would forget it. She all but forgot it.</p>
<p class="t0">What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">And came so near death in the dark of years,</p>
<p class="t0">That when it woke and came to life again</p>
<p class="t0">The flower was different from the parent seed.</p>
<p class="t0">It came back vaguely at the glass one day,</p>
<p class="t0">As she stood saying her name over aloud,</p>
<p class="t0">Striking it gently across her lowered eyes</p>
<p class="t0">To make it go well with the way she looked.</p>
<p class="t0">What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay</p>
<p class="t0">In having too much meaning. Other names,</p>
<p class="t0">As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,</p>
<p class="t0">Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,</p>
<p class="t0">But hadn&rsquo;t as it went. (She knew a Rose.)</p>
<p class="t0">This difference from other names it was</p>
<p class="t0">Made people notice it&mdash;and notice her.</p>
<p class="t0">(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)</p>
<p class="t0">Her problem was to find out what it asked</p>
<p class="t0">In dress or manner of the girl who bore it.</p>
<p class="t0">If she could form some notion of her mother&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">What she had thought was lovely, and what good.</p>
<p class="t0">This was her mother&rsquo;s childhood home;</p>
<p class="t0">The house one story high in front, three stories</p>
<p class="t0">On the end it presented to the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p class="t0">(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)</p>
<p class="t0">Her mother&rsquo;s bedroom was her father&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p class="t0">Where she could watch her mother&rsquo;s picture fading.</p>
<p class="t0">Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible</p>
<p class="t0">A maple leaf she thought must have been laid</p>
<p class="t0">In wait for her there. She read every word</p>
<p class="t0">Of the two pages it was pressed between</p>
<p class="t0">As if it was her mother speaking to her.</p>
<p class="t0">But forgot to put the leaf back in closing</p>
<p class="t0">And lost the place never to read again.</p>
<p class="t0">She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So she looked for herself, as everyone</p>
<p class="t0">Looks for himself, more or less outwardly.</p>
<p class="t0">And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,</p>
<p class="t0">May still have been what led her on to read,</p>
<p class="t0">And think a little, and get some city schooling.</p>
<p class="t0">She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may</p>
<p class="t0">Have had to do with it&mdash;she sometimes wondered.</p>
<p class="t0">So, till she found herself in a strange place</p>
<p class="t0">For the name Maple to have brought her to,</p>
<p class="t0">Taking dictation on a paper pad,</p>
<p class="t0">And in the pauses when she raised her eyes</p>
<p class="t0">Watching out of a nineteenth story window</p>
<p class="t0">An airship laboring with unship-like motion</p>
<p class="t0">And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond the highest city built with hands.</p>
<p class="t0">Someone was saying in such natural tones</p>
<p class="t0">She almost wrote the words down on her knee,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Do you know you remind me of a tree&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">A maple tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t6">&ldquo;Because my name is Maple?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>

<p class="t0">I have to let them call me what they like.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They were both stirred that he should have divined</p>
<p class="t0">Without the name her personal mystery.</p>
<p class="t0">It made it seem as if there must be something</p>
<p class="t0">She must have missed herself. So they were married,</p>
<p class="t0">And took the fancy home with them to live by.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They went on pilgrimage once to her father&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t0">(The house one story high in front, three stories</p>
<p class="t0">On the side it presented to the road)</p>
<p class="t0">To see if there was not some special tree</p>
<p class="t0">She might have overlooked. They could find none,</p>
<p class="t0">Not so much as a single tree for shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.</p>
<p class="t0">She told him of the bookmark maple leaf</p>
<p class="t0">In the big Bible, and all she remembered</p>
<p class="t0">Of the place marked with it&mdash;&ldquo;Wave offering,</p>
<p class="t0">Something about wave offering, it said.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never asked your father outright, have you?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have, and been put off sometime, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">(This was her faded memory of the way</p>
<p class="t0">Once long ago her father had put himself off.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Because no telling but it may have been</p>
<p class="t0">Something between your father and your mother</p>
<p class="t0">Not meant for us at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t10">&ldquo;Not meant for me?</p>
<p class="t0">Where would the fairness be in giving me</p>
<p class="t0">A name to carry for life, and never know</p>
<p class="t0">The secret of?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="t6">&ldquo;And then it may have been</p>
<p class="t0">Something a father couldn&rsquo;t tell a daughter</p>

<p class="t0">It may have been their one lapse into fancy</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twould be too bad to make him sorry for</p>
<p class="t0">By bringing it up to him when he was too old.</p>
<p class="t0">Your father feels us round him with our questing,</p>
<p class="t0">And holds us off unnecessarily,</p>
<p class="t0">As if he didn&rsquo;t know what little thing</p>
<p class="t0">Might lead us on to a discovery.</p>
<p class="t0">It was as personal as he could be</p>
<p class="t0">About the way he saw it was with you</p>
<p class="t0">To say your mother, had she lived, would be</p>
<p class="t0">As far again as from being born to bearing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Just one look more with what you say in mind,</p>
<p class="t0">And I give up&rdquo;; which last look came to nothing.</p>
<p class="t0">But, though they now gave up the search forever,</p>
<p class="t0">They clung to what one had seen in the other</p>
<p class="t0">By inspiration. It proved there was something.</p>
<p class="t0">They kept their thoughts away from when the maples</p>
<p class="t0">Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam</p>
<p class="t0">Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house.</p>
<p class="t0">When they made her related to the maples,</p>
<p class="t0">It was the tree the autumn fire ran through</p>
<p class="t0">And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark</p>
<p class="t0">Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.</p>
<p class="t0">They always took their holidays in autumn.</p>
<p class="t0">Once they came on a maple in a glade,</p>
<p class="t0">Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,</p>
<p class="t0">And every leaf of foliage she&rsquo;d worn</p>
<p class="t0">Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.</p>
<p class="t0">But its age kept them from considering this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="t0">Twenty-five years ago at Maple&rsquo;s naming</p>
<p class="t0">It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling</p>
<p class="t0">The next cow might have licked up out at pasture.</p>
<p class="t0">Could it have been another maple like it?</p>
<p class="t0">They hovered for a moment near discovery,</p>
<p class="t0">Figurative enough to see the symbol,</p>
<p class="t0">But lacking faith in anything to mean</p>
<p class="t0">The same at different times to different people.</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them</p>
<p class="t0">From thinking it could be a thing so bridal.</p>
<p class="t0">And anyway it came too late for Maple.</p>
<p class="t0">She used her hands to cover up her eyes.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We would not see the secret if we could now:</p>
<p class="t0">We are not looking for it any more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,</p>
<p class="t0">Made a girl&rsquo;s marriage, and ruled in her life.</p>
<p class="t0">No matter that the meaning was not clear.</p>
<p class="t0">A name with meaning could bring up a child,</p>
<p class="t0">Taking the child out of the parents&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p class="t0">Better a meaningless name, I should say,</p>

<p class="t0">Name children some names and see what you do.</p>

<h2 id="ch6">THE AXE-HELVE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve known ere now an interfering branch</p>
<p class="t0">Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me.</p>
<p class="t0">But that was in the woods, to hold my hand</p>
<p class="t0">From striking at another alder&rsquo;s roots,</p>
<p class="t0">And that was, as I say, an alder branch.</p>
<p class="t0">This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day</p>
<p class="t0">Behind me on the snow in my own yard</p>
<p class="t0">Where I was working at the chopping-block,</p>
<p class="t0">And cutting nothing not cut down already.</p>
<p class="t0">He caught my axe expertly on the rise,</p>
<p class="t0">When all my strength put forth was in his favor,</p>
<p class="t0">Held it a moment where it was, to calm me,</p>
<p class="t0">Then took it from me&mdash;and I let him take it.</p>
<p class="t0">I didn&rsquo;t know him well enough to know</p>
<p class="t0">What it was all about. There might be something</p>
<p class="t0">He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor</p>
<p class="t0">He might prefer to say to him disarmed.</p>
<p class="t0">But all he had to tell me in French-English</p>
<p class="t0">Was what he thought of&mdash;not me, but my axe;</p>
<p class="t0">Me only as I took my axe to heart.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Made on machine,&rdquo; he said, ploughing the grain</p>
<p class="t0">With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran</p>
<p class="t0">Across the handle&rsquo;s long drawn serpentine,</p>
<p class="t0">Like the two strokes across a dollar sign.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You give her one good crack, she&rsquo;s snap raght off.</p>
<p class="t0">Den where&rsquo;s your hax-ead flying t&rsquo;rough de hair?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>

<p class="t0">De second growt&rsquo; I cut myself&mdash;tough, tough!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t0">Something to sell? That wasn&rsquo;t how it sounded.</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove</p>
<p class="t0">My welcome differed from no other welcome.</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.</p>
<p class="t0">So long as he would leave enough unsaid,</p>
<p class="t0">I shouldn&rsquo;t mind his being overjoyed</p>
<p class="t0">(If overjoyed he was) at having got me</p>
<p class="t0">Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe</p>
<p class="t0">That not everybody else knew was to count</p>
<p class="t0">For nothing in the measure of a neighbor.</p>
<p class="t0">Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,</p>
<p class="t0">A Frenchman couldn&rsquo;t get his human rating!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair</p>
<p class="t0">That had as many motions as the world:</p>
<p class="t0">One back and forward, in and out of shadow,</p>
<p class="t0">That got her nowhere; one more gradual,</p>
<p class="t0">Sideways, that would have run her on the stove</p>
<p class="t0">In time, had she not realized her danger</p>
<p class="t0">And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,</p>
<p class="t0">And set herself back where she started from.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t spick too much Henglish&mdash;dat&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I was afraid, in brightening first on me,</p>
<p class="t0">Then on Baptiste, as if she understood</p>
<p class="t0">What passed between us, she was only feigning.</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more</p>
<p class="t0">Than for himself, so placed he couldn&rsquo;t hope</p>
<p class="t0">To keep his bargain of the morning with me</p>
<p class="t0">In time to keep me from suspecting him</p>
<p class="t0">Of really never having meant to keep it.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,</p>
<p class="t0">A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me</p>
<p class="t0">To have the best he had, or had to spare&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Not for me to ask which, when what he took</p>
<p class="t0">Had beauties he had to point me out at length</p>
<p class="t0">To insure their not being wasted on me.</p>
<p class="t0">He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,</p>
<p class="t0">Free from the least knot, equal to the strain</p>
<p class="t0">Of bending like a sword across the knee.</p>
<p class="t0">He showed me that the lines of a good helve</p>
<p class="t0">Were native to the grain before the knife</p>
<p class="t0">Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves</p>
<p class="t0">Put on it from without. And there its strength lay</p>
<p class="t0">For the hard work. He chafed its long white body</p>
<p class="t0">From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.</p>
<p class="t0">He tried it at the eye-hole in the axe-head.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hahn, hahn,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t need much taking down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste knew how to make a short job long</p>
<p class="t0">For love of it, and yet not waste time either.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste on his defence about the children</p>
<p class="t0">He kept from school, or did his best to keep&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p class="t0">Whatever school and children and our doubts</p>
<p class="t0">Of laid-on education had to do</p>
<p class="t0">With the curves of his axe-helves and his having</p>
<p class="t0">Used these unscrupulously to bring me</p>
<p class="t0">To see for once the inside of his house.</p>
<p class="t0">Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one</p>
<p class="t0">To leave it to, whether the right to hold</p>
<p class="t0">Such doubts of education should depend</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the education of those who held them?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But now he brushed the shavings from his knee</p>
<p class="t0">And stood the axe there on its horse&rsquo;s hoof,</p>
<p class="t0">Erect, but not without its waves, as when</p>
<p class="t0">The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,</p>
<p class="t0">Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down</p>
<p class="t0">And in a little&mdash;a French touch in that.</p>

<h2 id="ch7">THE GRINDSTONE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Having a wheel and four legs of its own</p>
<p class="t0">Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone</p>
<p class="t0">To get it anywhere that I can see.</p>
<p class="t0">These hands have helped it go, and even race;</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the miles it may have thought it went,</p>
<p class="t0">Have got it one step from the starting place.</p>
<p class="t0">It stands beside the same old apple tree.</p>
<p class="t0">The shadow of the apple tree is thin</p>
<p class="t0">Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow.</p>
<p class="t0">All other farm machinery&rsquo;s gone in,</p>
<p class="t0">And some of it on no more legs and wheel</p>
<p class="t0">Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go.</p>
<p class="t0">(I&rsquo;m thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.)</p>
<p class="t0">For months it hasn&rsquo;t known the taste of steel,</p>
<p class="t0">Washed down with rusty water in a tin.</p>
<p class="t0">But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold,</p>
<p class="t0">Except in towns at night, is not a sin.</p>
<p class="t0">And, anyway, its standing in the yard</p>
<p class="t0">Under a ruinous live apple tree</p>
<p class="t0">Has nothing any more to do with me,</p>
<p class="t0">Except that I remember how of old</p>
<p class="t0">One summer day, all day I drove it hard,</p>
<p class="t0">And someone mounted on it rode it hard,</p>
<p class="t0">And he and I between us ground a blade.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I gave it the preliminary spin,</p>
<p class="t0">And poured on water (tears it might have been);</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p class="t0">And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed,</p>
<p class="t0">A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,</p>
<p class="t0">Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.</p>
<p class="t0">He turned on will-power to increase the load</p>
<p class="t0">And slow me down&mdash;and I abruptly slowed,</p>
<p class="t0">Like coming to a sudden railroad station.</p>
<p class="t0">I changed from hand to hand in desperation.</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered what machine of ages gone</p>
<p class="t0">This represented an improvement on.</p>
<p class="t0">For all I knew it may have sharpened spears</p>
<p class="t0">And arrowheads itself. Much use for years</p>
<p class="t0">Had gradually worn it an oblate</p>
<p class="t0">Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,</p>
<p class="t0">Appearing to return me hate for hate;</p>
<p class="t0">(But I forgive it now as easily</p>
<p class="t0">As any other boyhood enemy</p>
<p class="t0">Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere).</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered who it was the man thought ground&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">The one who held the wheel back or the one</p>
<p class="t0">Who gave his life to keep it going round?</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered if he really thought it fair</p>
<p class="t0">For him to have the say when we were done.</p>
<p class="t0">Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not for myself was I so much concerned.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh no!&mdash;although, of course, I could have found</p>
<p class="t0">A better way to pass the afternoon</p>
<p class="t0">Than grinding discord out of a grindstone,</p>
<p class="t0">And beating insects at their gritty tune.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor was I for the man so much concerned.</p>
<p class="t0">Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing</p>
<p class="t0">It looked as if he might be badly thrown</p>
<p class="t0">And wounded on his blade. So far from caring,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p class="t0">I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster,</p>
<p class="t0">(It ran as if it wasn&rsquo;t greased but glued);</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;d welcome any moderate disaster</p>
<p class="t0">That might be calculated to postpone</p>
<p class="t0">What evidently nothing could conclude.</p>
<p class="t0">The thing that made me more and more afraid</p>
<p class="t0">Was that we&rsquo;d ground it sharp and hadn&rsquo;t known,</p>
<p class="t0">And now were only wasting precious blade.</p>
<p class="t0">And when he raised it dripping once and tried</p>
<p class="t0">The creepy edge of it with wary touch,</p>
<p class="t0">And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed,</p>
<p class="t0">Only disinterestedly to decide</p>
<p class="t0">It needed a turn more, I could have cried</p>
<p class="t0">Wasn&rsquo;t there danger of a turn too much?</p>
<p class="t0">Mightn&rsquo;t we make it worse instead of better?</p>
<p class="t0">I was for leaving something to the whetter.</p>
<p class="t0">What if it wasn&rsquo;t all it should be? I&rsquo;d</p>

<p class="t0">He was all duty to her in a minute:</p>
<p class="t0">He had to run right off to look her up,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, how is my wife?</p>
<p class="t0">I hope she isn&rsquo;t getting into mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d been the hero of the mountain camps</p>
<p class="t0">Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped</p>
<p class="t0">The bark of a whole tamarack off whole,</p>
<p class="t0">As clean as boys do off a willow twig</p>
<p class="t0">To make a willow whistle on a Sunday</p>
<p class="t0">In April by subsiding meadow brooks.</p>
<p class="t0">They seemed to ask him just to see him go,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How is the wife, Paul?&rdquo; and he always went.</p>
<p class="t0">He never stopped to murder anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Who asked the question. He just disappeared&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Nobody knew in what direction,</p>
<p class="t0">Although it wasn&rsquo;t usually long</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p class="t0">Before they heard of him in some new camp,</p>
<p class="t0">The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.</p>
<p class="t0">The question everywhere was why should Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Object to being asked a civil question&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">A man you could say almost anything to</p>
<p class="t0">Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.</p>
<p class="t0">And there was one more not so fair to Paul:</p>
<p class="t0">That Paul had married a wife not his equal.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero,</p>
<p class="t0">She would have had to be a heroine;</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.</p>
<p class="t0">But if the story Murphy told was true,</p>
<p class="t0">She wasn&rsquo;t anything to be ashamed of.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t0">Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load</p>
<p class="t0">That wouldn&rsquo;t budge until they simply stretched</p>
<p class="t0">Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul told the boss the load would be all right,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The sun will bring your load in&rdquo;&mdash;and it did&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.</p>
<p class="t0">That&rsquo;s what is called a stretcher. But I guess</p>
<p class="t0">The one about his jumping so&rsquo;s to land</p>
<p class="t0">With both his feet at once against the ceiling,</p>
<p class="t0">And then land safely right side up again,</p>
<p class="t0">Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.</p>
<p class="t0">Well this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife</p>
<p class="t0">Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there,</p>
<p class="t0">And, as you might say, saw the lady born.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul worked at anything in lumbering.</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d been hard at it taking boards away</p>
<p class="t0">For&mdash;I forget&mdash;the last ambitious sawyer</p>
<p class="t0">To want to find out if he couldn&rsquo;t pile</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p class="t0">The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.</p>
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;d sliced the first slab off a big butt log,</p>
<p class="t0">And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back</p>
<p class="t0">To slam end on again against the saw teeth.</p>
<p class="t0">To judge them by the way they caught themselves</p>
<p class="t0">When they saw what had happened to the log,</p>
<p class="t0">They must have had a guilty expectation</p>
<p class="t0">Something was going to go with their slambanging.</p>
<p class="t0">Something had left a broad black streak of grease</p>
<p class="t0">On the new wood the whole length of the log</p>
<p class="t0">Except, perhaps, a foot at either end.</p>
<p class="t0">But when Paul put his finger in the grease,</p>
<p class="t0">It wasn&rsquo;t grease at all, but a long slot.</p>
<p class="t0">The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;First time I ever saw a hollow pine.</p>
<p class="t0">That comes of having Paul around the place.</p>
<p class="t0">Take it to hell for me,&rdquo; the sawyer said.</p>
<p class="t0">Everyone had to have a look at it,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.</p>
<p class="t0">(They treated it as his.) &ldquo;You take a jack-knife,</p>
<p class="t0">And spread the opening, and you&rsquo;ve got a dug-out</p>
<p class="t0">All dug to go a-fishing in.&rdquo; To Paul</p>
<p class="t0">The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty</p>
<p class="t0">Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.</p>
<p class="t0">There was no entrance for them to get in by.</p>
<p class="t0">It looked to him like some new kind of hollow</p>
<p class="t0">He thought he&rsquo;d <i>better</i> take his jack-knife to.</p>
<p class="t0">So after work that evening he came back</p>
<p class="t0">And let enough light into it by cutting</p>
<p class="t0">To see if it was empty. He made out in there</p>
<p class="t0">A slender length of pith, or was it pith?</p>
<p class="t0">It might have been the skin a snake had cast</p>
<p class="t0">And left stood up on end inside the tree</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p class="t0">The hundred years the tree must have been growing.</p>
<p class="t0">More cutting and he had this in both hands,</p>
<p class="t0">And, looking from it to the pond near by,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul wondered how it would respond to water.</p>
<p class="t0">Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air</p>
<p class="t0">He made in walking slowly to the beach</p>
<p class="t0">Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.</p>
<p class="t0">He laid it at the edge where it could drink.</p>
<p class="t0">At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.</p>
<p class="t0">At the next drink it grew invisible.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">And thought it must have melted. It was gone.</p>
<p class="t0">And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,</p>
<p class="t0">It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,</p>
<p class="t0">Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,</p>
<p class="t0">Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">And that made Paul in turn look back</p>
<p class="t0">To see if it was anyone behind him</p>
<p class="t0">That she was looking at instead of him.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy had been there watching all the time,</p>
<p class="t0">But from a shed where neither of them could see him.</p>
<p class="t0">There was a moment of suspense in birth</p>
<p class="t0">When the girl seemed too water-logged to live,</p>
<p class="t0">Before she caught her first breath with a gasp</p>
<p class="t0">And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,</p>
<p class="t0">And walked off talking to herself or Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Across the logs like backs of alligators,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul taking after her around the pond.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Next evening Murphy and some other fellows</p>
<p class="t0">Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,</p>
<p class="t0">From the bare top of which there is a view</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p class="t0">To other hills across a kettle valley.</p>
<p class="t0">And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,</p>
<p class="t0">They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the only glimpse that anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them</p>
<p class="t0">Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond.</p>
<p class="t0">More than a mile across the wilderness</p>
<p class="t0">They sat together half-way up a cliff</p>
<p class="t0">In a small niche let into it, the girl</p>
<p class="t0">Brightly, as if a star played on the place,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light</p>
<p class="t0">Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star,</p>
<p class="t0">As was apparent from what happened next.</p>
<p class="t0">All those great ruffians put their throats together,</p>
<p class="t0">And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,</p>
<p class="t0">As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.</p>
<p class="t0">Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,</p>
<p class="t0">But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.</p>
<p class="t0">She went out like a firefly, and that was all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So there were witnesses that Paul was married,</p>
<p class="t0">And not to anyone to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="t0">Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs</p>
<p class="t0">About his wife to keep her to himself.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul was what&rsquo;s called a terrible possessor.</p>
<p class="t0">Owning a wife with him meant owning her.</p>
<p class="t0">She wasn&rsquo;t anybody else&rsquo;s business,</p>
<p class="t0">Either to praise her, or so much as name her,</p>
<p class="t0">And he&rsquo;d thank people not to think of her.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy&rsquo;s idea was that a man like Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Wouldn&rsquo;t be spoken to about a wife</p>
<p class="t0">In any way the world knew how to speak.</p>

<h2 id="ch9">WILD GRAPES</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What tree may not the fig be gathered from?</p>
<p class="t0">The grape may not be gathered from the birch?</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s all you know the grape, or know the birch.</p>
<p class="t0">As a girl gathered from the birch myself</p>
<p class="t0">Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.</p>
<p class="t0">I was born, I suppose, like anyone,</p>
<p class="t0">And grew to be a little boyish girl</p>
<p class="t0">My brother could not always leave at home.</p>
<p class="t0">But that beginning was wiped out in fear</p>
<p class="t0">The day I swung suspended with the grapes,</p>
<p class="t0">And was come after like Eurydice</p>
<p class="t0">And brought down safely from the upper regions;</p>
<p class="t0">And the life I live now&rsquo;s an extra life</p>
<p class="t0">I can waste as I please on whom I please.</p>
<p class="t0">So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,</p>
<p class="t0">And give myself out as two different ages,</p>
<p class="t0">One of them five years younger than I look&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One day my brother led me to a glade</p>
<p class="t0">Where a white birch he knew of stood alone,</p>
<p class="t0">Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,</p>
<p class="t0">And heavy on her heavy hair behind,</p>
<p class="t0">Against her neck, an ornament of grapes.</p>
<p class="t0">Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.</p>
<p class="t0">One bunch of them, and there began to be</p>
<p class="t0">Bunches all round me growing in white birches,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="t0">The way they grew round Lief the Lucky&rsquo;s German;</p>
<p class="t0">Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,</p>
<p class="t0">As the moon used to seem when I was younger,</p>
<p class="t0">And only freely to be had for climbing.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother did the climbing; and at first</p>
<p class="t0">Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter</p>
<p class="t0">And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;</p>
<p class="t0">Which gave him some time to himself to eat,</p>
<p class="t0">But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.</p>
<p class="t0">So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,</p>
<p class="t0">He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth,</p>
<p class="t0">And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here, take a tree-top, I&rsquo;ll get down another.</p>
<p class="t0">Hold on with all your might when I let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I said I had the tree. It wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p class="t0">The opposite was true. The tree had me.</p>
<p class="t0">The minute it was left with me alone</p>
<p class="t0">It caught me up as if I were the fish</p>
<p class="t0">And it the fishpole. So I was translated</p>
<p class="t0">To loud cries from my brother of &ldquo;Let go!</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t you know anything, you girl? Let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">But I, with something of the baby grip</p>
<p class="t0">Acquired ancestrally in just such trees</p>
<p class="t0">When wilder mothers than our wildest now</p>
<p class="t0">Hung babies out on branches by the hands</p>
<p class="t0">To dry or wash or tan, I don&rsquo;t know which</p>
<p class="t0">(You&rsquo;ll have to ask an evolutionist)&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I held on uncomplainingly for life.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What are you doing up there in those grapes?</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t be afraid. A few of them won&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p class="t0">I mean, they won&rsquo;t pick you if you don&rsquo;t them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Much danger of my picking anything!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">By that time I was pretty well reduced</p>
<p class="t0">To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now you know how it feels,&rdquo; my brother said,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,</p>
<p class="t0">That when it thinks it has escaped the fox</p>
<p class="t0">By growing where it shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;on a birch,</p>
<p class="t0">Where a fox wouldn&rsquo;t think to look for it&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And if he looked and found it, couldn&rsquo;t reach it&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Just then come you and I to gather it.</p>
<p class="t0">Only you have the advantage of the grapes</p>
<p class="t0">In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,</p>
<p class="t0">And promise more resistance to the picker.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,</p>
<p class="t0">And still I clung. I let my head fall back,</p>
<p class="t0">And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears</p>
<p class="t0">Against my brother&rsquo;s nonsense; &ldquo;Drop,&rdquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch you in my arms. It isn&rsquo;t far.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Drop or I&rsquo;ll shake the tree and shake you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,</p>
<p class="t0">My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Why, if she isn&rsquo;t serious about it!</p>
<p class="t0">Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll bend the tree down and let you down by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">I don&rsquo;t know much about the letting down;</p>
<p class="t0">But once I felt ground with my stocking feet</p>
<p class="t0">And the world came revolving back to me,</p>
<p class="t0">I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you weigh anything?</p>
<p class="t0">Try to weigh something next time, so you won&rsquo;t</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p class="t0">Be run off with by birch trees into space.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It wasn&rsquo;t my not weighing anything</p>
<p class="t0">So much as my not knowing anything&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">My brother had been nearer right before.</p>
<p class="t0">I had not taken the first step in knowledge;</p>
<p class="t0">I had not learned to let go with the hands,</p>
<p class="t0">As still I have not learned to with the heart,</p>
<p class="t0">And have no wish to with the heart&mdash;nor need,</p>
<p class="t0">That I can see. The mind&mdash;is not the heart.</p>
<p class="t0">I may yet live, as I know others live,</p>
<p class="t0">To wish in vain to let go with the mind&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me</p>

<h2 id="ch10">PLACE FOR A THIRD</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nothing to say to all those marriages!</p>
<p class="t0">She had made three herself to three of his.</p>
<p class="t0">The score was even for them, three to three.</p>
<p class="t0">But come to die she found she cared so much:</p>
<p class="t0">She thought of children in a burial row;</p>
<p class="t0">Three children in a burial row were sad.</p>
<p class="t0">One man&rsquo;s three women in a burial row</p>
<p class="t0">Somehow made her impatient with the man.</p>
<p class="t0">And so she said to Laban, &ldquo;You have done</p>
<p class="t0">A good deal right; don&rsquo;t do the last thing wrong.</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t make me lie with those two other women.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Laban said, No, he would not make her lie</p>
<p class="t0">With anyone but that she had a mind to,</p>
<p class="t0">If that was how she felt, of course, he said.</p>
<p class="t0">She went her way. But Laban having caught</p>
<p class="t0">This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,</p>
<p class="t0">And anxious to make all he could of it</p>
<p class="t0">With something he remembered in himself,</p>
<p class="t0">Tried to think how he could exceed his promise,</p>
<p class="t0">And give good measure to the dead, though thankless.</p>
<p class="t0">If that was how she felt, he kept repeating.</p>
<p class="t0">His first thought under pressure was a grave</p>
<p class="t0">In a new boughten grave plot by herself,</p>
<p class="t0">Under he didn&rsquo;t care how great a stone:</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.</p>
<p class="t0">And weren&rsquo;t there special cemetery flowers,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p class="t0">That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest:</p>
<p class="t0">The flowers will go on with grief awhile,</p>
<p class="t0">And no one seem neglecting or neglected?</p>
<p class="t0">A prudent grief will not despise such aids.</p>
<p class="t0">He thought of evergreen and everlasting.</p>
<p class="t0">And then he had a thought worth many of these.</p>
<p class="t0">Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy</p>
<p class="t0">Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,</p>
<p class="t0">And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.</p>
<p class="t0">How would she like to sleep her last with him?</p>
<p class="t0">Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He found the grave a town or two away,</p>
<p class="t0">The headstone cut with <i>John, Beloved Husband</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">Beside it room reserved, the say a sister&rsquo;s,</p>
<p class="t0">A never-married sister&rsquo;s of that husband,</p>
<p class="t0">Whether Eliza would be welcome there.</p>
<p class="t0">The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.</p>
<p class="t0">So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing</p>
<p class="t0">Of where Eliza wanted <i>not</i> to lie,</p>
<p class="t0">And who had thought to lay her with her first love,</p>
<p class="t0">Begged simply for the grave. The sister&rsquo;s face</p>
<p class="t0">Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.</p>
<p class="t0">She wanted to do right. She&rsquo;d have to think.</p>
<p class="t0">Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;</p>
<p class="t0">And she was old and poor&mdash;but she cared, too.</p>
<p class="t0">They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,</p>
<p class="t0">Then turned him out to go on other errands</p>
<p class="t0">She said he might attend to in the village,</p>
<p class="t0">While she made up her mind how much she cared&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And how much Laban cared&mdash;and why he cared,</p>
<p class="t0">(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p class="t0">She&rsquo;d looked Eliza up her second time,</p>
<p class="t0">A widow at her second husband&rsquo;s grave,</p>
<p class="t0">And offered her a home to rest awhile</p>
<p class="t0">Before she went the poor man&rsquo;s widow&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p class="t0">Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.</p>
<p class="t0">She and Eliza had been friends through all.</p>
<p class="t0">Who was she to judge marriage in a world</p>
<p class="t0">Whose Bible&rsquo;s so confused in marriage counsel?</p>
<p class="t0">The sister had not come across this Laban;</p>
<p class="t0">A decent product of life&rsquo;s ironing-out;</p>
<p class="t0">She must not keep him waiting. Time would press</p>
<p class="t0">Between the death day and the funeral day.</p>
<p class="t0">So when she saw him coming in the street</p>
<p class="t0">She hurried her decision to be ready</p>
<p class="t0">To meet him with his answer at the door.</p>
<p class="t0">Laban had known about what it would be</p>
<p class="t0">From the way she had set her poor old mouth,</p>
<p class="t0">To do, as she had put it, what was right.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She gave it through the screen door closed between them:</p>

<p class="t0">Eliza&rsquo;s had too many other men.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Laban was forced to fall back on his plan</p>
<p class="t0">To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in:</p>

<p class="t0">And carried itself like a pile of dishes</p>

<p class="t0">Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,</p>
<p class="t0">Another from the bedroom to the attic,</p>
<p class="t0">Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it.</p>
<p class="t0">Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.</p>
<p class="t0">I was a baby: I don&rsquo;t know where I was.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Mother.</i> The only fault my husband found with me&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I went to sleep before I went to bed,</p>
<p class="t0">Especially in winter when the bed</p>
<p class="t0">Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,</p>
<p class="t0">But left an open door to cool the room off</p>
<p class="t0">So as to sort of turn me out of it.</p>
<p class="t0">I was just coming to myself enough</p>
<p class="t0">To wonder where the cold was coming from,</p>
<p class="t0">When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom</p>
<p class="t0">And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p class="t0">The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on</p>
<p class="t0">When there was water in the cellar in spring</p>
<p class="t0">Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone</p>
<p class="t0">Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,</p>
<p class="t0">The way a man with one leg and a crutch,</p>
<p class="t0">Or a little child, comes up. It wasn&rsquo;t Toffile:</p>
<p class="t0">It wasn&rsquo;t anyone who could be there.</p>
<p class="t0">The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked</p>
<p class="t0">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust</p>
<p class="t0">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the bones. I knew them&mdash;and good reason.</p>
<p class="t0">My first impulse was to get to the knob</p>
<p class="t0">And hold the door. But the bones didn&rsquo;t try</p>
<p class="t0">The door; they halted helpless on the landing,</p>
<p class="t0">Waiting for things to happen in their favor.</p>
<p class="t0">The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.</p>
<p class="t0">I never could have done the thing I did</p>
<p class="t0">If the wish hadn&rsquo;t been too strong in me</p>
<p class="t0">To see how they were mounted for this walk.</p>
<p class="t0">I had a vision of them put together</p>
<p class="t0">Not like a man, but like a chandelier.</p>
<p class="t0">So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.</p>
<p class="t0">A moment he stood balancing with emotion,</p>
<p class="t0">And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire</p>
<p class="t0">Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.</p>
<p class="t0">Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)</p>
<p class="t0">Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,</p>
<p class="t0">The way he did in life once; but this time</p>
<p class="t0">I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,</p>
<p class="t0">And fell back from him on the floor myself.</p>
<p class="t0">The finger-pieces slid in all directions.</p>
<p class="t0">(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p class="t0">Hand me my button-box&mdash;it must be there.)</p>
<p class="t0">I sat up on the floor and shouted, &ldquo;Toffile,</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s coming up to you.&rdquo; It had its choice</p>
<p class="t0">Of the door to the cellar or the hall.</p>
<p class="t0">It took the hall door for the novelty,</p>
<p class="t0">And set off briskly for so slow a thing,</p>
<p class="t0">Still going every which way in the joints, though,</p>
<p class="t0">So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,</p>
<p class="t0">From the slap I had just now given its hand.</p>
<p class="t0">I listened till it almost climbed the stairs</p>
<p class="t0">From the hall to the only finished bedroom,</p>
<p class="t0">Before I got up to do anything;</p>
<p class="t0">Then ran and shouted, &ldquo;Shut the bedroom door,</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile, for my sake!&rdquo; &ldquo;Company,&rdquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me get up; I&rsquo;m too warm in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">So lying forward weakly on the handrail</p>
<p class="t0">I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light</p>
<p class="t0">(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own</p>
<p class="t0">I could see nothing. &ldquo;Toffile, I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s with us in the room though. It&rsquo;s the bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What bones?&rdquo; &ldquo;The cellar bones&mdash;out of the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">That made him throw his bare legs out of bed</p>
<p class="t0">And sit up by me and take hold of me.</p>
<p class="t0">I wanted to put out the light and see</p>
<p class="t0">If I could see it, or else mow the room,</p>
<p class="t0">With our arms at the level of our knees,</p>
<p class="t0">And bring the chalk-pile down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s looking for another door to try.</p>
<p class="t0">The uncommonly deep snow has made him think</p>
<p class="t0">Of his old song, <i>The Wild Colonial Boy</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">He always used to sing along the tote-road.</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s after an open door to get out-doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p class="t0">Let&rsquo;s trap him with an open door up attic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,</p>
<p class="t0">Almost the moment he was given an opening,</p>
<p class="t0">The steps began to climb the attic stairs.</p>
<p class="t0">I heard them. Toffile didn&rsquo;t seem to hear them.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; I slammed to the door and held the knob.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Toffile, get nails.&rdquo; I made him nail the door shut,</p>
<p class="t0">And push the headboard of the bed against it.</p>
<p class="t0">Then we asked was there anything</p>
<p class="t0">Up attic that we&rsquo;d ever want again.</p>
<p class="t0">The attic was less to us than the cellar.</p>
<p class="t0">If the bones liked the attic, let them have it,</p>
<p class="t0">Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes</p>
<p class="t0">Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed</p>
<p class="t0">Behind the door and headboard of the bed,</p>
<p class="t0">Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,</p>
<p class="t0">That&rsquo;s what I sit up in the dark to say&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">To no one any more since Toffile died.</p>
<p class="t0">Let them stay in the attic since they went there.</p>
<p class="t0">I promised Toffile to be cruel to them</p>
<p class="t0">For helping them be cruel once to him.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now that they&rsquo;ve got it settled whose I be,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m going to tell them something they won&rsquo;t like:</p>
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;ve got it settled wrong, and I can prove it.</p>
<p class="t0">Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting</p>
<p class="t0">To make a present of me to each other.</p>
<p class="t0">They don&rsquo;t dispose me, either one of them,</p>
<p class="t0">To spare them any trouble. Double trouble&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t0">Always the witch&rsquo;s motto anyway.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll double theirs for both of them&mdash;you watch me.</p>
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;ll find they&rsquo;ve got the whole thing to do over,</p>
<p class="t0">That is, if facts is what they want to go by.</p>
<p class="t0">They set a lot (now don&rsquo;t they?) by a record</p>
<p class="t0">Of Arthur Amy&rsquo;s having once been up</p>
<p class="t0">For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p class="t0">I could have told them any time this twelvemonth</p>
<p class="t0">The Arthur Amy I was married to</p>
<p class="t0">Couldn&rsquo;t have been the one they say was up</p>
<p class="t0">In Warren at March Meeting for the reason</p>
<p class="t0">He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t but fifteen at the time they say.</p>
<p class="t0">The Arthur Amy I was married to</p>
<p class="t0">Voted the only times he ever voted,</p>
<p class="t0">Which wasn&rsquo;t many, in the town of Wentworth.</p>
<p class="t0">One of the times was when &rsquo;twas in the warrant</p>
<p class="t0">To see if the town wanted to take over</p>
<p class="t0">The tote road to our clearing where we lived.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll tell you who&rsquo;d remember&mdash;Heman Lapish.</p>
<p class="t0">Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.</p>
<p class="t0">So now they&rsquo;ve dragged it through the law courts once</p>
<p class="t0">I guess they&rsquo;d better drag it through again.</p>
<p class="t0">Wentworth and Warren&rsquo;s both good towns to live in,</p>
<p class="t0">Only I happen to prefer to live</p>
<p class="t0">In Wentworth from now on; and when all&rsquo;s said,</p>
<p class="t0">Right&rsquo;s right, and the temptation to do right</p>
<p class="t0">When I can hurt someone by doing it</p>
<p class="t0">Has always been too much for me, it has.</p>
<p class="t0">I know of some folks that&rsquo;d be set up</p>
<p class="t0">At having in their town a noted witch:</p>
<p class="t0">But most would have to think of the expense</p>
<p class="t0">That even I would be. They ought to know</p>
<p class="t0">That as a witch I&rsquo;d often milk a bat</p>
<p class="t0">And that&rsquo;d be enough to last for days.</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;d make my position stronger, think,</p>
<p class="t0">If I was to consent to give some sign</p>
<p class="t0">To make it surer that I was a witch?</p>
<p class="t0">It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no sign, I s&rsquo;pose, when Mallice Huse</p>
<p class="t0">Said that I took him out in his old age</p>
<p class="t0">And rode all over everything on him</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p class="t0">Until I&rsquo;d had him worn to skin and bones.</p>
<p class="t0">And if I&rsquo;d left him hitched unblanketed</p>
<p class="t0">In front of one Town Hall, I&rsquo;d left him hitched</p>
<p class="t0">In front of every one in Grafton County.</p>
<p class="t0">Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,</p>
<p class="t0">The poor old man. It would have been all right</p>
<p class="t0">If some one hadn&rsquo;t said to gnaw the posts</p>
<p class="t0">He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,</p>
<p class="t0">So they could recognize them. Not a post</p>
<p class="t0">That they could hear tell of was scarified.</p>
<p class="t0">They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.</p>
<p class="t0">Then that same smarty someone said to look&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed</p>
<p class="t0">The crib he slept in&mdash;and as sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p class="t0">They found he&rsquo;d gnawed the four posts of his bed,</p>
<p class="t0">All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?</p>
<p class="t0">Not that he hadn&rsquo;t gnawed the hitching posts</p>
<p class="t0">He said he had besides. Because a horse</p>
<p class="t0">Gnaws in the stable ain&rsquo;t no proof to me</p>
<p class="t0">He don&rsquo;t gnaw trees and posts and fences too.</p>
<p class="t0">But everybody took it for a proof.</p>
<p class="t0">I was a strapping girl of twenty then.</p>
<p class="t0">The smarty someone who spoiled everything</p>
<p class="t0">Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.</p>
<p class="t0">That was the way he started courting me.</p>
<p class="t0">He never said much after we were married,</p>
<p class="t0">But I mistrusted he was none too proud</p>
<p class="t0">Of having interfered in the Huse business.</p>
<p class="t0">I guess he found he got more out of me</p>
<p class="t0">By having me a witch. Or something happened</p>
<p class="t0">To turn him round. He got to saying things</p>
<p class="t0">To undo what he&rsquo;d done and make it right,</p>
<p class="t0">Like, &ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t come back from kiting yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p class="t0">Last night was one of her nights out. She&rsquo;s kiting.</p>
<p class="t0">She thinks when the wind makes a night of it</p>
<p class="t0">She might as well herself.&rdquo; But he liked best</p>
<p class="t0">To let on he was plagued to death with me:</p>
<p class="t0">If anyone had seen me coming home</p>
<p class="t0">Over the ridgepole, &rsquo;stride of a broomstick,</p>
<p class="t0">As often as he had in the tail of the night,</p>
<p class="t0">He guessed they&rsquo;d know what he had to put up with.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough</p>
<p class="t0">Off from the house as far as we could keep</p>
<p class="t0">And from barn smells you can&rsquo;t wash out of ploughed ground</p>
<p class="t0">With all the rain and snow of seven years;</p>
<p class="t0">And I don&rsquo;t mean just skulls of Roger&rsquo;s Rangers</p>
<p class="t0">On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,</p>
<p class="t0">Only bewitched so I would last him longer.</p>
<p class="t0">Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,</p>
<p class="t0">I made him gather me wet snow berries</p>
<p class="t0">On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.</p>
<p class="t0">I made him do it for me in the dark.</p>
<p class="t0">And he liked everything I made him do.</p>
<p class="t0">I hope if he is where he sees me now</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s so far off he can&rsquo;t see what I&rsquo;ve come to.</p>
<p class="t0">You <i>can</i> come down from everything to nothing.</p>
<p class="t0">All is, if I&rsquo;d a-known when I was young</p>
<p class="t0">And full of it, that this would be the end,</p>
<p class="t0">It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if I&rsquo;d had the courage</p>
<p class="t0">To make so free and kick up in folks&rsquo; faces.</p>

<p class="t0">You must have heard of Clara Robinson,</p>
<p class="t0">The poetess who wrote the book of verses</p>

<p class="t0">The posies on her inner window sill,</p>

<p class="t0">A whole edition in a packing-case,</p>
<p class="t0">That, overflowing like a horn of plenty,</p>
<p class="t0">Or like the poetess&rsquo;s heart of love,</p>
<p class="t0">Had spilled them near the window toward the light,</p>
<p class="t0">Where driven rain had wet and swollen them.</p>
<p class="t0">Enough to stock a village library&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">With stone and lead to unprotected glass:</p>
<p class="t0">Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.</p>
<p class="t0">How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?</p>
<p class="t0">By being invisible for what it was,</p>
<p class="t0">Or else by some remoteness that defied them</p>
<p class="t0">To find out what to do to hurt a poem.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,</p>
<p class="t0">To send it sailing out the attic window</p>
<p class="t0">Till it caught the wind, and, opening out its covers,</p>
<p class="t0">Tried to improve on sailing like a tile</p>
<p class="t0">By flying like a bird (silent in flight,</p>
<p class="t0">But all the burden of its body song),</p>
<p class="t0">Only to tumble like a stricken bird,</p>
<p class="t0">And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.</p>
<p class="t0">Books were not thrown irreverently about.</p>
<p class="t0">They simply lay where some one now and then,</p>
<p class="t0">Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet</p>
<p class="t0">And left it lying where it fell rejected.</p>
<p class="t0">Here were all those the poetess&rsquo;s life</p>

<p class="t0">At having eased her heart of one more copy&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">I don&rsquo;t want it stirred by the heat of the sun.</p>

<p class="t0">With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;</p>
<p class="t0">When they were halted by a tumbled wall</p>
<p class="t0">With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,</p>

<p class="t0">No footstep moved it. &ldquo;This is all,&rdquo; they sighed,</p>

<p class="t0">A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them</p>

<p class="t0">I doubt if you&rsquo;re as living as you look.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus till he had them almost feeling dared</p>
<p class="t0">To stretch a proffering hand&mdash;and a spell-breaking.</p>

<p class="t0">Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from.</p>

<p class="t0">To think to know the country and not know</p>
<p class="t0">The hillside on the day the sun lets go</p>
<p class="t0">Ten million silver lizards out of snow!</p>
<p class="t0">As often as I&rsquo;ve seen it done before</p>
<p class="t0">I can&rsquo;t pretend to tell the way it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p class="t0">It looks as if some magic of the sun</p>
<p class="t0">Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor</p>
<p class="t0">And the light breaking on them made them run.</p>
<p class="t0">But if I thought to stop the wet stampede,</p>
<p class="t0">And caught one silver lizard by the tail,</p>
<p class="t0">And put my foot on one without avail,</p>
<p class="t0">And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed</p>
<p class="t0">In front of twenty others&rsquo; wriggling speed,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">In the confusion of them all aglitter,</p>
<p class="t0">And birds that joined in the excited fun</p>
<p class="t0">By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,</p>
<p class="t0">I have no doubt I&rsquo;d end by holding none.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It takes the moon for this. The sun&rsquo;s a wizard</p>
<p class="t0">By all I tell; but so&rsquo;s the moon a witch.</p>
<p class="t0">From the high west she makes a gentle cast</p>
<p class="t0">And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,</p>
<p class="t0">She has her spell on every single lizard.</p>
<p class="t0">I fancied when I looked at six o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p class="t0">The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.</p>
<p class="t0">The moon was waiting for her chill effect.</p>
<p class="t0">I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p class="t0">In every lifelike posture of the swarm,</p>
<p class="t0">Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.</p>
<p class="t0">Across each other and side by side they lay.</p>
<p class="t0">The spell that so could hold them as they were</p>
<p class="t0">Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm</p>
<p class="t0">To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the moon&rsquo;s: she held them until day,</p>
<p class="t0">One lizard at the end of every ray.</p>
<p class="t0">The thought of my attempting such a stay!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A plow, they say, to plow the snow.</p>
<p class="t0">They cannot mean to plant it, though&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">At having cultivated rock.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The tree the tempest with a crash of wood</p>
<p class="t0">Throws down in front of us is not to bar</p>
<p class="t0">Our passage to our journey&rsquo;s end for good,</p>
<p class="t0">But just to ask us who we think we are</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Insisting always on our own way so.</p>
<p class="t0">She likes to halt us in our runner tracks,</p>
<p class="t0">And make us get down in a foot of snow</p>
<p class="t0">Debating what to do without an axe.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And yet she knows obstruction is in vain:</p>
<p class="t0">We will not be put off the final goal</p>
<p class="t0">We have it hidden in us to attain,</p>
<p class="t0">Not though we have to seize earth by the pole</p>

<h2 id="ch44">OUR SINGING STRENGTH</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It snowed in spring on earth so dry and warm</p>
<p class="t0">The flakes could find no landing place to form.</p>
<p class="t0">Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold,</p>
<p class="t0">And still they failed of any lasting hold.</p>
<p class="t0">They made no white impression on the black.</p>
<p class="t0">They disappeared as if earth sent them back.</p>
<p class="t0">Not till from separate flakes they changed at night</p>
<p class="t0">To almost strips and tapes of ragged white</p>
<p class="t0">Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed,</p>
<p class="t0">And all go back to winter but the road.</p>
<p class="t0">Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead.</p>
<p class="t0">The grass lay flattened under one great tread.</p>
<p class="t0">Borne down until the end almost took root,</p>
<p class="t0">The rangey bough anticipated fruit</p>
<p class="t0">With snowballs cupped in every opening bud.</p>
<p class="t0">The road alone maintained itself in mud,</p>
<p class="t0">Whatever its secret was of greater heat</p>
<p class="t0">From inward fires or brush of passing feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In spring more mortal singers than belong</p>
<p class="t0">To any one place cover us with song.</p>
<p class="t0">Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng;</p>
<p class="t0">Some to go further north to Hudson&rsquo;s Bay,</p>
<p class="t0">Some that have come too far north back away,</p>
<p class="t0">Really a very few to build and stay.</p>
<p class="t0">Now was seen how these liked belated snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The fields had nowhere left for them to go;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;d soon exhausted all there was in flying;</p>
<p class="t0">The trees they&rsquo;d had enough of with once trying</p>
<p class="t0">And setting off their heavy powder load.</p>
<p class="t0">They could find nothing open but the road.</p>
<p class="t0">So there they let their lives be narrowed in</p>
<p class="t0">By thousands the bad weather made akin.</p>
<p class="t0">The road became a channel running flocks</p>
<p class="t0">Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks.</p>
<p class="t0">I drove them under foot in bits of flight</p>
<p class="t0">That kept the ground, almost disputing right</p>
<p class="t0">Of way with me from apathy of wing,</p>
<p class="t0">A talking twitter all they had to sing.</p>
<p class="t0">A few I must have driven to despair</p>
<p class="t0">Made quick asides, but having done in air</p>
<p class="t0">A whir among white branches great and small</p>
<p class="t0">As in some too much carven marble hall</p>
<p class="t0">Where one false wing beat would have brought down all,</p>
<p class="t0">Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover,</p>
<p class="t0">To suffer the same driven nightmare over.</p>
<p class="t0">One such storm in a lifetime couldn&rsquo;t teach them</p>
<p class="t0">That back behind pursuit it couldn&rsquo;t reach them;</p>
<p class="t0">None flew behind me to be left alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown</p>
<p class="t0">The country&rsquo;s singing strength thus brought together,</p>
<p class="t0">That though repressed and moody with the weather</p>
<p class="t0">Was none the less there ready to be freed</p>
<p class="t0">And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed.</p>

<h2 id="ch45">THE LOCKLESS DOOR</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It went many years,</p>
<p class="t0">But at last came a knock,</p>
<p class="t0">And I thought of the door</p>
<p class="t0">With no lock to lock.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I blew out the light,</p>
<p class="t0">I tip-toed the floor,</p>
<p class="t0">And raised both hands</p>
<p class="t0">In prayer to the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But the knock came again.</p>
<p class="t0">My window was wide;</p>
<p class="t0">I climbed on the sill</p>
<p class="t0">And descended outside.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Back over the sill</p>
<p class="t0">I bade a &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">To whatever the knock</p>
<p class="t0">At the door may have been.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So at a knock</p>
<p class="t0">I emptied my cage</p>
<p class="t0">To hide in the world</p>
<p class="t0">And alter with age.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
